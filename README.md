# Defect Detection Example

This project tackles a real-world computer vision problem: image classification and object detection applied locating defects on medicinal capsules.  
The goal is to build, train, and fully deploy the model, from beginning to end.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `app/`: inference code and deployment interface
- `models/`: saved trained models


## How to Run

Run all code sequentially from the Jupyter notebooks inside **/notebooks**.  
The project uses relative paths and assumes the dataset files are placed inside the **/data** folder.
